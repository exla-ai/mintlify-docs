# Welcome to Exla

Exla is an advanced model optimization platform that makes AI models smaller, faster, and more deployable on constrained devices. We provide hardware-aware model optimization, enabling developers to deploy efficient, production-ready models with just a few lines of code.

## Key Features

- **Hardware-Aware Optimization:** Automatically selects the best implementation for your hardware platform.
- **Model Compression:** Reduces model size and tries to maintain accuracy
- **Deployment Tools:** Simplifies model deployment on edge devices.

## Why Exla?

Optimizing models for edge devices like NVIDIA Jetsons and Raspberry Pis is notoriously complex and time-consuming. Exla automates this process, making it possible to run large models on low-power hardware without sacrificing performance.
