# RoboPoint

RoboPoint is a powerful multimodal model optimized for robotic perception and understanding. It combines visual and language capabilities to enable robots to understand their environment and follow instructions.

## Environment Setup

Before using RoboPoint, you need to set up your environment:

1. First, install the Exla SDK by following the [installation instructions](/quickstart)

2. Clone the examples repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/exla-ai/exla-sdk-examples.git
```

3. Navigate to the RoboPoint example directory:
```bash
cd exla-sdk-examples/robopoint
```

## Running RoboPoint

You can run the RoboPoint example with a single command:

```bash
python example_robopoint.py
```

This will:
1. Load the optimized RoboPoint model
2. Process sample images
3. Demonstrate multimodal capabilities

## Example Code

Here's a simplified version of how to use RoboPoint in your own projects:

```python
from exla.models.robopoint import robopoint

model = robopoint()

model.inference(
    image_path="data/sink.jpg",
    text_instruction="Find a few spots within the vacant area on the rightmost white plate.",
    output="data/sink_output.png"
)   
```

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Understanding**: Combines vision and language for comprehensive scene understanding
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and localizes objects in the environment
- **Instruction Following**: Interprets natural language instructions in the context of visual scenes
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understands spatial relationships between objects
- **Hardware Optimized**: Runs efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs

## Use Cases

- **Robotic Manipulation**: Identify objects for grasping and manipulation
- **Navigation**: Understand the environment for safe navigation
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Follow natural language instructions
- **Scene Understanding**: Analyze complex scenes and relationships between objects
