# MobileNet

MobileNet is a lightweight computer vision model designed specifically for mobile and edge devices. It provides efficient image classification capabilities while maintaining a small footprint.

## Overview

MobileNet is optimized for scenarios where computational resources are limited but real-time image classification is required. Key features include:

- Efficient architecture designed for mobile and edge devices
- Good balance between accuracy and model size
- Fast inference times
- Suitable for real-time applications

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use MobileNet for image classification:

```python
from exla.models.mobilenet import MobileNet
from PIL import Image

# Initialize the model
model = MobileNet()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Classify the image
predictions = model.classify(image)
print(predictions)
```

## Example Output

The model returns a list of predictions with class labels and confidence scores:

```python
[
    {"label": "golden retriever", "score": 0.85},
    {"label": "Labrador retriever", "score": 0.10},
    {"label": "tennis ball", "score": 0.03},
    # ... more predictions
]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

For processing multiple images efficiently:

```python
images = [Image.open(f) for f in ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]]
batch_predictions = model.classify_batch(images)
```

### Custom Top-K

You can specify how many top predictions to return:

```python
# Return only the top 3 predictions
predictions = model.classify(image, top_k=3)
```

## Performance Considerations

MobileNet is designed for efficiency, but there are still some considerations for optimal performance:

- Memory usage: ~5-10MB
- Inference time: Typically 10-50ms on modern devices
- Power consumption: Lower than larger models like ResNet

## Example Applications

- Real-time object recognition in mobile apps
- Smart camera features
- Augmented reality applications
- IoT devices with visual recognition capabilities

## Limitations

- Lower accuracy compared to larger models like ResNet
- Limited ability to detect small objects or fine details
- Performance varies based on image quality and lighting conditions

## Comparison with Other Models

| Model | Size | Accuracy | Inference Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MobileNet | Small (~5MB) | Good | Fast |
| ResNet34 | Medium (~80MB) | Better | Medium |
| Vision Transformers | Large (>200MB) | Best | Slow |

For applications requiring higher accuracy and where computational resources are less constrained, consider using [ResNet34](/models/resnet34) instead.
