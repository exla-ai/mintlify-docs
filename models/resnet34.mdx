# ResNet34

ResNet34 is a deep residual neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks. It offers a good balance between model size and accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of computer vision applications.

## Overview

ResNet34 is part of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, which introduced skip connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks. Key features include:

- 34-layer deep architecture with residual connections
- Higher accuracy than lightweight models like MobileNet
- Reasonable computational requirements for edge deployment
- Robust feature extraction capabilities

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use ResNet34 for image classification:

```python
from exla.models.resnet34 import ResNet34
from PIL import Image

# Initialize the model
model = ResNet34()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("path/to/your/image.jpg")

# Classify the image
predictions = model.classify(image)
print(predictions)
```

## Example Output

The model returns a list of predictions with class labels and confidence scores:

```python
[
    {"label": "golden retriever", "score": 0.92},
    {"label": "Labrador retriever", "score": 0.05},
    {"label": "tennis ball", "score": 0.01},
    # ... more predictions
]
```

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing

For processing multiple images efficiently:

```python
images = [Image.open(f) for f in ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg"]]
batch_predictions = model.classify_batch(images)
```

### Feature Extraction

You can use ResNet34 as a feature extractor for downstream tasks:

```python
# Extract features from the image
features = model.extract_features(image)

# Use these features for custom downstream tasks
# such as custom classifiers, clustering, etc.
```

### Custom Top-K

You can specify how many top predictions to return:

```python
# Return only the top 5 predictions
predictions = model.classify(image, top_k=5)
```

## Performance Considerations

ResNet34 provides a good balance between accuracy and computational requirements:

- Memory usage: ~80MB
- Inference time: Typically 50-200ms on modern devices
- Higher accuracy than MobileNet, but requires more computational resources

## Example Applications

- High-quality image classification
- Object detection systems (when used as a backbone)
- Content moderation
- Medical image analysis
- Industrial quality control

## Limitations

- Larger model size compared to MobileNet
- Higher latency, which may impact real-time applications on resource-constrained devices
- May struggle with very fine-grained classification tasks

## Comparison with Other Models

| Model | Size | Accuracy | Inference Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MobileNet | Small (~5MB) | Good | Fast |
| ResNet34 | Medium (~80MB) | Better | Medium |
| Vision Transformers | Large (>200MB) | Best | Slow |

For applications where model size and inference speed are critical, consider using [MobileNet](/models/mobilenet) instead.
